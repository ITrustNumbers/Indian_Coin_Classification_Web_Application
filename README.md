# Indian Coin Classification Web Application

![Application Image](https://github.com/ITrustNumbers/Indian_Coin_Classification_Web_Application/blob/master/Developed_Web_Application.png)

This repository contains the front-end code, that revolves around deploying a Machine Learning Model Developed in one of my research study named "A Novel Convolutional Neural Network for Classifying Indian Coins by Denomination"

The Model Deployed is a scaled down version of the model proposed in the study. It was scaled down due to the slug size limit imposed by the free tier account on Heroku [(read more about heroku)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/limits)
